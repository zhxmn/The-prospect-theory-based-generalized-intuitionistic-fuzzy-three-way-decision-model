The description of the dataset of prospect theory-based generalized intuitionistic fuzzy three-way decision model
Four data sets from UCI database (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php): Somerville Happiness Survey (T1), Quality of red wine (T2), Quality of white wine (T3), and Computer Hardware (T4). A data set from Kaggle database (https://www.kaggle.com): Boston housing (T5). T1 contains seven attributes: availability of city services (ACS), cost of housing (CH), quality of public schools (QPS), local police (LP), maintenance of streets and sidewalks (MSS), availability of social community events (ASCE), residents' satisfaction (RS). T2 contains seven attributes: volatile acidity (VA), citric acid (CA), density (DE), PH, sulphates (SU), alcohol (AL), flavors of wine (FW). T3 contains five attributes: density (DE), PH, chlorides (CL) alcohol (AL) and flavors of wine (FW). T4 contains seven attributes: machine cycle unit (MCU), minimum main memory (MINM), maximum main memory (MAXM), cache (CCH), minimum number of channels (MNC), maximum number of channels (MUC), relative performance (RP). T5 contains thirteen attributes: crime rate (CR), proportion of residential land (PRL), non-residential proportion (NRP), environmental index (ENI), average number of rooms (ANR), number of old houses (NOH), distance from employment centers (DEC), traffic index (TI), property tax (PT), ratio of teachers to students (RTS), percentage of black people (PBP), proportion of low-income people (PLIP), median housing prices (MHP). The specific information of data sets is shown as followed. Note that the RP attribute of T4 data is neither a cost nor a benefit attribute, but it will be used later in the validity test experiment.
